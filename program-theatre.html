          Musical Theatre is a wonderful way of bringing out the confidence in young people by exploring the 3 main disciplines, dance, singing and acting. Musical Theatre discovers childrens' ability to express themselves in many different ways. Students explore different show themes and learn
          techniques such as improvisation, characterisation, script work, accents, voice projection, mime, comedy, physical theatre, dance genres, vocal technique, harmonies, ensemble singing and much more! They will also get to perform many times a year.
