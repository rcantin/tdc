          <p>Join us at The Dream Centre for our fantastic, all-inclusive birthday parties for kids! Choose from our selection of Dance, Gymnastics, Ninja Warrior, Martial Arts and Princess themed parties and let the fun begin! Parties are two hours in length and include a pizza party with juice, chips, and themed activities led by our professional team of staff. Decorations, plates, utensils and napkins are also provided. All you need to bring is cake or cupcakes, loot bags, serving knife, candles and lighter!  You're welcome to show up 15 minutes before your party begins.</p>
          <h5 class="font-weight-bold">What do I need to know?</h5>
          <p>There is a deposit of $100 due at the time of booking and $125 for Princess Parties.   Deposits are non refundable. The remainder of the party cost will be charged the Tuesday before the party. Full payment must be made before the day of the party. Our minimum number of guests is 8. Our maximum number of guests is 18, however the studio needs to be notified 14 DAYS before the party if the number of guests will be over 12. If your number of guests is 11 or less, please confirm ONE WEEK in advance. We cannot guarantee that your request for more than 12 guests can be accommodated if you do not notify the studio in a respectful amount of time. This allows us to staff accordingly and to keep safety as our number one priority. Larger parties can be accommodated by request. Please do not open gifts at the studio.</p>
          <h5 class="font-weight-bold">Is there an age limit?</h5>
          <p>Yes, depending on which type of party you choose. See specifics below:</p>
          <p>Gymnastics & Ninja’s age limit is 4 years for the Birthday Child. Any guests who are 3 years need to have 1 parent/guardian accompany them into the gym and supervise them as the group rotates through the circuits. That parent/guardian must also sign a waiver for themselves. Under 3 years is NOT PERMITTED for Gymnastics or Ninja parties.</p>          
          <p>There is no age limit for Dance, Martial Arts or Princess parties as parents are allowed to go into the studio. Anyone under 3 years, needs to have a parent/guardian accompany the child.</p>
          <h5 class="font-weight-bold">Are the guest's parents allowed to stay?</h5>
          <p>Yes. There is a lobby area for parents to sit and wait if necessary. Parents are allowed in the studio for Dance, Martial Arts and Princess parties. For Gymnastics and Ninja parties, only the parents of the birthday child are allowed on the gym floor. Other parents are NOT allowed in the gym or on the equipment for safety purposes.</p>
