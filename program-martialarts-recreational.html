            <h3 class="text-blue font-weight-bold">Belt Evaluations</h3>
            <p>Belt Evaluations will take place every three months during the season for students in our Traditional Martial Arts classes (not fitness kickboxing or lil ninjas)</p>          
            <ul>
              <li>All students who are registered between September 1st and October 31st and have their White to Green belt will be enrolled to evaluate in November.</li>
              <li>All students who are registered between November 1st and January 31st  and have their White to Green belt will be enrolled to evaluate in February.</li>

            </ul>
            <p>Belt evaluations give students a tangible demonstration of their skill level, demonstrate their areas of strengths and improvement, and assist in goal setting for their next stage. Students grow in confidence when they are able to present their learning, and resiliency when they have to work through challenges. Belt evaluations focus on creating lifelong learners and instilling the tenants of martial arts that create community members who can protect themselves and others.</p>          
            <p>Families will have the option of having the eval done in class, or register for a timeslot on the weekend. All registered families will be contacted a minimum of 2 weeks prior to evals with further details.</p>
            <p>All students enrolled in the evaluation will be billed $49.99 on November 1, 2021 & February 1, 2022. If a student starts later in the season or elects to do a third belt evaluation, the billing day is May 1, 2022. If a student does not pass their belt evaluation, they will retake the evaluation when they have completed the necessary corrections, as well as completed a 1:1 private lesson during class time to work on their skill set. There is no charge for re-evaluations.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Evaluation 1: November 7th - 19th</li>
              <li>Evaluation 2: February 20th - March 4th</li>
