    "question": "My child has to take medications during the day. Can I leave it with the Staff for my child to take?",
    "answer": "Yes. We will help your child properly take their medication at the appropriate time. However, all medication must be in its original container and properly labelled for us to administer it. We also provide the option to hold the medication at the front desk for your child throughout the week if you would like, so you do not have to bring it every day. Our front desk is locked and can only be opened by Senior Staff Members.  If your child requires medication, you will need to complete a medication form at the time of drop off or we can have one emailed to you to be completed ahead of time."
